what is software engineering?
	Software engineering is an engineering discipline which is concerned with all aspects of software production
	소프트웨어 공학은 소프트웨어 생산의 모든 측면을 다루는 공학 분야이다.

four fundamental activities in software porcesses
	software specification, software design and implementation, software validation, software evolution

essential attributes of good software
	acceptability, dependability and security, efficiency, maintainability

process of incremental development and delivery and what are the advantages of using incremental development and delivery

	그림으로 단계 설명

	advantages 
	the cost of accommodating changes to customer requirements is reduced  고객 요구사항의 변경 사항을 수용하는 비용이 절감됨
	it is easier to get customer feedback on development work that has been done  완료된 개발 작업에 대한 고객 피드백을 받는 것이 더 쉽습니다.
	more rapid delivery and deployment of useful software to the customer is possible  고객에게 유용한 소프트웨어를 보다 신속하게 전달하고 배포할 수 있습니다.
 
approaches we can user to reduce the costs of rework
	Change anticipation : acticipate possible changes , porototype system may be developed to show som key features of the systrem to customer
	
	Change tolerance : incremental development. proposed changes may be implemented in increments that have not yet
			been developed. if this is impossible then only a single increment bay have bbe altered to incorporate the change


the principles agile methods lead to the accelerated development and deployment of software
	individual and interactions over processes and tools
	working software over comprehensive documentation
	customer collaboration over contract negotiation
	responding to change over following a plan

important characteristics of XP
	user stories for specification : user requirements are expressed as user stories or scenarios
	refactoring : it proposes constant code improvement to make changes easier when they have to be implemented
	test-driven development :writing tests before code clarifies the requirements to be implemented
	pair programming : programmers sit together at the same computer to develop the soft ware

examples of non functional requirements in Mentcare system
	product requirement - 몇시부터 몇시까지는 작동이 가능해야한다, downtime이 5초이상 생기면 안된다
	organizational requirement - 인증카드와 같은 것으로 인증이 가능해야한다
	external requirement - 보안?
	
why it is important to make a distinction between developing the user requrements and system requirements
	user requirement are intended to describe the system's functions and features from a user perspective 
	and it is essential that users understand these requirements
	사용자 요구사항은 사용자 관점에서 시스템의 기능 및 기능을 설명하기 위한 것이며 사용자가 이러한 요구사항을 이해하는 것이 필수적이다.

	system requirement are much more detailed than the user requirements and are intended to be a precise specification for the system
	that may be part of a system contract
	시스템 요구사항은 사용자 요구사항보다 훨씬 더 상세하며 시스템 계약의 일부일 수 있는 시스템의 정확한 사양이 되기 위한 것이다.
plan- driven - this is a safety-critical system so requires a lot of up-front analysis before implementation
incremental development - this is a system where requirements will change and there will be an extensive user interface components
reuse-based approach - this is a asystem whose requirements are fairly well-known and which will be used in an
			environment in confunction with lots of other systems such as a research grant management system

주어진 요구사항이 functional한 요구사항인지 non-functional한 요구사항인지 판단
